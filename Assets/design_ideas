signal jammers
	high combo
		commands all do very little at first, but very slowly build up to eventually huge payoffs
			commands are based off the combo counter
			meta coms flip things around? like a jester assassin kinda feel?
		highly likely to have 8 coms at their disposal

	low combo
		commands on their own hit fairly hard, but the combos are very short
			maybe like meta coms immediately cancel out command effects
		there are like 1 or 2 combos that have 2 coms but all the rest are just single com
		in order to balance out the requirement to hit cast at every other beat, make it hard to clear coms in general
			like you should have to look a couple coms ahead to plan

	chaotic/complex
		the options available to you every com are based on rng and have complex interactions with one another
		likes playing at low BPMs

	debuffer
		jammer that has terrible tools for dealing with their own negative gamestate, but who can easily mess with the opponent's gamestate
		shouldn't be great at killing, but should be really annoying to play against

	basic man
		token basic jammer that is bad at nothing but also good at nothing
		beginner jammer/model for the rest of the game

	state machine
		jammer with unique and finicky resource pool in the form of a super basic cpu-like system
		has N registers that it can manipulate with instructions, and commands that depend on the states of those N registers
	
	at least one jammer with a non-4/4 measure length

	jammer that swings harder the more cards they have

what coms are shared between jammers?

charge meter as special finisher
