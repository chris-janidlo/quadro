"characters"
	high combo
		spells all do very little at first, but very slowly build up to eventually huge payoffs
			spells are based off the combo counter
			meta notes flip things around? like a jester assassin kinda feel?
		highly likely to have 8 notes at their disposal

	low combo
		spells on their own hit fairly hard, but the combos are very short
			maybe like meta notes immediately cancel out spell effects
		there are like 1 or 2 combos that have 2 notes but all the rest are just single note
		in order to balance out the requirement to hit cast at every other beat, make it hard to clear notes in general
			like you should have to look a couple notes ahead to plan

	chaotic/complex
		the options available to you every note are based on rng and have complex interactions with one another
		likes playing at low BPMs

	debuffer
		character that has terrible tools for dealing with their own negative gamestate, but who can easily mess with the opponent's gamestate
		shouldn't be great at killing, but should be really annoying to play against

	basic man
		token basic character that is bad at nothing but also good at nothing
		beginner character/model for the rest of the game

	state machine
		character with unique and finicky resource pool in the form of a super basic cpu-like system
		has N registers that it can manipulate with instructions, and spells that depend on the states of those N registers
	
	at least one character with a non-4/4 measure length

what spells are shared between characters?
