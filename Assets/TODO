FIXME:

TODO:
===== GAMEPLAY =====
	major beat difficulty tuning
		current difficulty should be somewhere in 50%-75% range
		starting difficulty as easy as every 2 beats or every 4 beats
		ending difficulty incorporating broken triplets and sixteenth note patterns

===== CODE =====
	make full command diamond visual clickable (including command)

	move command (in)active colors to Colors.cs

	group command visual in with command diamond on the code side?

	add additional jammers

	for future non-track command targets: make ICommandTarget (or something similar) to mark classes that can be targeted

	add some kind of match info object containing the friendly player and the opposing player, and pass that to commands

	make driver dependency injection generic enough to work with any number of players

	sync up music sources with timing source

	reduce primitive obsession in track (bsteps, rhythm difficulty)?

===== MUSIC =====
	create basic beat
		dial-up inspired chords
		chilled out nostalgic chords seem to work well

===== UI =====
	group UI for CPUs + resource bars + misc UI section and put it all on an in-game terminal monitor
		80x60 character terminal? *pure text UI????*
		give it some curve and make the characters bleed a little light

	reusable hacker typing animation component
		probably using Transitionable
		transition from anything to empty string: delete characters
		transition from empty string to anything: type characters
		transition from one non-empty to another: delete then type
		probably include some dope ass fading as well

	physical command input button interface
		heavily inspired by 80s computer keyboards like commodore vic-20 and zx spectrum
		each command is a radio-ish button with an led indicator. the button top has the command's name. depending on the command, there's some indication about stuff like what it can clear and what it can combo to (grease pencil, tape with pen on it, fancy embossed stuff). if the led is lit, you can play the command. the button's visible "pushable" state (ie, in or out) corresponds with the led. when you play a valid command input, it depresses, any non-comboable commands depress as well, and any comboable commands pop out
		also have a radio button section for cpu switching

	make hit quality feedback emanate from the beat line

	misc UI section, for things that the player doesn't need to worry about but likes to know
		combo
		difficulty level
		bsteps
	
	make command diamond cards flash on input

	make command in center of diamond match outer d-pad active/inactive indication
