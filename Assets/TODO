FIXME:
turn based driver

TODO:
have rhythm return quality of hit
	notes are more effective the more accurate they are

make cast dependent on mana
	get one mana per card clear
	mana of spell is based solely off main note

split card rng in two - main rng and garbage rng
	main rng is used on the regular every-few-beats spawns
	garbage is used whenever a player manually causes a card spawn (like tetris garbage)
	main and garbage have their own seeds so they don't cross contaminate
	seeds should be the same for every player in a multiplayer match

determine whether or not to simplify meta combos so that they no longer depend on the main note

better immediate feedback (failure/success per note)
