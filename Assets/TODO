FIXME:
turn based driver

TODO:
split card rng in two - main rng and garbage rng
	main rng is used on the regular every-few-beats spawns
	garbage is used whenever a player manually causes a card spawn (like tetris garbage)
	main and garbage have their own seeds so they don't cross contaminate
	seeds should be the same for every player in a multiplayer match

determine whether or not to simplify meta combos so that they no longer depend on the main note

better immediate feedback (failure/success per note)
