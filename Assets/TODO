FIXME:

TODO:
===== GAMEPLAY =====
	better design for registers input zone?

	register that can go negative or two registers?

	chord buffing drill down
		buff an entire input zone (3 chords, each buffs 4 inputs)
		buff two adjacent directions across input zones (4 chords, each buffs 6 inputs)

===== CODE =====
	create AI

	consistent controls - face buttons, directional buttons, and 3 modifiers

	register changes

	harder timing on smaller beat subdivisions

	chord buff system implementation

	sync up music sources with timing source

===== MUSIC =====
	expand basic beat when chord designs are done

===== UI =====
	group UI for CPUs(?) + resource bars + misc UI section and put it all on an in-game terminal monitor
		80x60 character terminal? *pure text UI????*
		give it some curve and make the characters bleed a little light
		might put CPUs in a little LCD screen instead depending on the jammer

	reusable hacker typing animation component
		probably using Transitionable
		transition from anything to empty string: delete characters
		transition from empty string to anything: type characters
		transition from one non-empty to another: delete then type
		probably include some dope ass fading as well

	physical command input button interface
		heavily inspired by 80s computer keyboards like commodore vic-20 and zx spectrum
		each command is a radio-ish button with an led indicator. the button top has the command's name. depending on the command, there's some indication about stuff like what it can clear and what it can combo to (grease pencil, tape with pen on it, fancy embossed stuff). if the led is lit, you can play the command. the button's visible "pushable" state (ie, in or out) corresponds with the led. when you play a valid command input, it depresses, any non-comboable commands depress as well, and any comboable commands pop out
		also have a radio button section for cpu switching

	make hit quality feedback emanate from the beat line

	misc UI section, for things that the player doesn't need to worry about but likes to know
		combo
		difficulty level
		bsteps
