FIXME:
turn based driver skips sometimes

TODO:
===== GAMEPLAY =====

===== CODE =====
	for future non-track spell targets: make ISpellTarget (or something similar) to mark classes that can be targeted

	make driver dependency injection generic enough to work with any number of players

	sync up music sources with timing source

	make BPM change gradually

	add game startup delay

===== MUSIC =====
	create basic beat
		dial-up inspired chords
		chilled out nostalgic chords seem to work well

===== UI =====
	armor meter

	reorder UI weight/centering
