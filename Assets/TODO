FIXME:
turn based driver skips sometimes

TODO:
===== GAMEPLAY =====
	completely get rid of cards. move to health instead
		make damage measure-based still?
		make rhythm not locked to the beat
		add block system a la StS
			decays over time

	charge system
		add a meter called the "charge" meter or something similar
			TODO: figure out lore (stores excess electricity?)
		every time you hit a beat successfully, the charge increases. the more accurate you are, the better the increase (might even make the least accurate hit-tier not add anything)
		every time you miss a beat or hit when you shouldn't, the charge decreases
		when the charge meter fills up, a character-dependent finisher happens, and the meter resets back to zero

===== CODE =====
	for future non-track spell targets: make ISpellTarget (or something similar) to mark classes that can be targeted

	make driver dependency injection generic enough to work with any number of players

	sync up music sources with timing source

===== MUSIC =====
	create basic beat
		dial-up inspired chords
		chilled out nostalgic chords seem to work well

===== UI =====
	health bar

	reorder UI weight/centering

	rework colors and language to not chide the player for playing a non-beat-clearing note
		call it something other than "flub"
		mark non-cleared cards symbolically instead of with colors?
