FIXME:
turn based driver skips sometimes

TODO:
===== GAMEPLAY =====

===== CODE =====
	make 3D aspect of track less janky
		move it out of the canvas and into just regular 2D space?

	add additional jammers

	for future non-track command targets: make ICommandTarget (or something similar) to mark classes that can be targeted

	add some kind of match info object containing the friendly player and the opposing player, and pass that to commands

	make driver dependency injection generic enough to work with any number of players

	sync up music sources with timing source

===== MUSIC =====
	create basic beat
		dial-up inspired chords
		chilled out nostalgic chords seem to work well

===== UI =====
	armor meter

	reorder UI weight/centering
		design for multiple resolutions

	new com diamond
		each com gets a card that displays following information:
			main effect (when command is null)
			meta effect (when command isn't null)
			indicator that says main/meta
			the symbols that this com can clear

	new font
