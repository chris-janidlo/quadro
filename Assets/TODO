FIXME:
turn based driver skips sometimes

TODO:
===== GAMEPLAY =====

===== CODE =====
	for future non-track command targets: make ICommandTarget (or something similar) to mark classes that can be targeted

	make driver dependency injection generic enough to work with any number of players

	sync up music sources with timing source

	make BPM change gradually

===== MUSIC =====
	create basic beat
		dial-up inspired chords
		chilled out nostalgic chords seem to work well

===== UI =====
	armor meter

	reorder UI weight/centering

	new com diamond
		each com gets a card that displays following information:
			main effect (when command is null)
			meta effect (when command isn't null)
			indicator that says main/meta
			the symbols that this com can clear
