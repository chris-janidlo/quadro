FIXME:
turn based driver

TODO:
dial up music! figure out how dial up works and use that
	chilled out nostalgic chords seem to work well

reword game text for new hacker mentality
	spell -> command?
	card -> packet
	track -> network something something

charge system
	update rhythm to return quality of hit
		3-tiered system (TODO: labels for tiers)
	add a meter called the "charge" meter or something similar
		TODO: figure out lore (stores excess electricity?)
	every time you hit a beat successfully, the charge increases. the more accurate you are, the better the increase (might even make the least accurate hit-tier not add anything)
	every time you miss a beat or hit when you shouldn't, the charge decreases
	when the charge meter fills up, the current spell gets a bonus to the magnitude of its effectiveness, and the meter resets back to zero

make cast dependent on mana
	get one mana per card clear
	mana of spell is based solely off main note

split card rng in two - main rng and garbage rng
	main rng is used on the regular every-few-beats spawns
	garbage is used whenever a player manually causes a card spawn (like tetris garbage)
	main and garbage have their own seeds so they don't cross contaminate
	seeds should be the same for every player in a multiplayer match

determine whether or not to simplify meta combos so that they no longer depend on the main note

better immediate feedback (failure/success per note)
